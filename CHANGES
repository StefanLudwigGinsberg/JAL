Pre-Release:

This version added the Lua codebase including the testsuite.
It made all of the API distinct to the project and exposed it
uniquely through files, paths and versioning. Enforcement of
warning-free builds was begun and a few such issues were resolved.
It also fixed a minor issue of dependency in the testsuite.

The project was made to build with debugging by default.
