Just Another Lua (JAL) is based on Lua 5.3.6 and created by
Stefan Ludwig Ginsberg. It is an effort to improve the language
by revising existing features as well as adding new ones. The
project intends to stay mostly compatible but breaking changes
will occur to some extent. As such this is a split of Lua.
